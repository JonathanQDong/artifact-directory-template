Title:
Utilizing Deep Learning to Uncover Antimicrobial Peptides and Investigating their Associations with Diverse Diseases

Abstract:
As pathogens start to become more resistant to our current antibiotics, we
will soon need new antibiotics to fight various forms of bacteria. By 2050,
drug-resistant pathogens are expected to be the leading cause of death in the

world (Oâ€™Neill 2016). One way to create new antibiotics is to identify pep-
tides, sequences of amino acids, that have antimicrobial properties. These are

commonly known as antimicrobial peptides(AMP). These AMPs are known to

regulate inflammation, kill certain types of cancer cells, and fight various in-
fections and diseases. In this project, we use an Attention model(Vaswani

et al. 2023) to classify peptides as AMPs or non-AMPs. We call the peptides
that our model predicts to be AMPs: predicted AMPs. We then run this model
on a dataset called FINRISK, which contains both DNA and health data on a
randomly selected group of Finnish people. Using the output of our model
and the health data in FINRISK, we found the correlation between having one
of these predicted AMPs and having a disease recorded in FINRISK. In the 71
study participants we looked at, we found a moderately strong correlation
between having 4 predicted AMPs and COPD, though these results are still
preliminary in nature. We would need to run the model over all participants
in FINRISK before being able to test our results in a wet lab.
